**STATISTICS PROJECT**-**CUSTOMER SHOPPING TRENDS**
**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
This project focuses on applying statistical concepts and data analysis techniques to understand real-world datasets and extract meaningful business insights. 
The analysis covers key topics such as sampling methods, Central Limit Theorem (CLT), normal distribution, and Z-score analysis, which are essential for data-driven decision-making.
The project demonstrates how large datasets can be efficiently analyzed using samples, how CLT helps in estimating population characteristics, and why checking for normal distribution is important before performing hypothesis testing. 
It also explains how Z-scores are used to identify outliers and unusual values that may indicate errors, risks, or exceptional business scenarios.
**OBJECTIVES**
The main objectives of this project are:
**To understand the importance of sampling**
Learn how sampling helps analyze large datasets efficiently while still representing the population accurately.
**To apply the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**
Observe how sample means behave and understand how CLT enables reliable estimation and prediction in data analytics.
**To analyze data distribution**
Identify whether the data follows a normal distribution and understand why this is essential for statistical testing.
**To calculate key statistical measures**
Compute mean and standard deviation to summarize and interpret numerical data effectively.
**To detect outliers using Z-Score**
Identify unusual or extreme values that may indicate errors, risks, or exceptional business cases.
**To build a strong foundation in statistics for analytics**
Connect statistical theory with practical, real-world business applications.
**To support data-driven decision making**
Use statistical insights to improve accuracy, reliability, and confidence in business decisions.

**ANALYSIS PERFORMED**
**1.Population Analysis**
Identified the full dataset as the population.
Calculated the population mean for the selected numerical column.
**Sampling Techniques**
Created a Random Sample to ensure unbiased data selection.
Created a Systematic Sample by selecting every nth record.
Compared sample means with the population mean to observe variation.
**Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Analysis**
Drew multiple samples of size 30 from the dataset.
Calculated the mean of each sample.
Plotted the distribution of sample means.
Observed that the sample mean distribution approaches a normal shape, validating CLT.
**Normal Distribution Analysis**
Calculated mean and standard deviation for a numerical column.
Applied the 68–95–99.7 rule to interpret data spread.
**Z-Score Calculation & Outlier Detection**
Calculated Z-scores for all values.
Added a new column named Z_Score.
Identified values with Z > +3 or Z < −3.
Marked these values as outliers.
**Business Interpretation**
Translated statistical results into simple business insights.
Explained how sampling, CLT, normal distribution, and Z-score support data-driven decisions.
 **FINAL CONCLUSION:**
The analysis confirms that statistical techniques can be effectively used to summarize data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and support reliable business decision-making.
Plotted a histogram to visualize data distribution.
Checked whether the data approximately follows a normal distribution.
